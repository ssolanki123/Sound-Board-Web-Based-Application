Vanilla JS:
    For our Vanilla JS file, it took roughly 7.17 seconds to finish the page containing 22.22 mb of data
    transferred and 27 requests to load playlist 1 throttled at 3g speeds.  For playlist 2, it took 13,66 seconds to load 
    the page containing 9.34 mb of data and 31 requests at 3g speeds. The load time was 449 ms.
    
    At 4g lte speeds, it took 4.57 seconds to finish the page containing 23.05 mb of data transferred and 26 requests
    to load playlist 1 throttled at 4g lte speeds. For playlist 2, it took 1.40 min to load the page 
    containing 42.77 of dta and 61 requests at 4g lte speeds. 
    
    More data is transferred at 4g lte speeds than at 3g speeds.
    
    
    
JQuery:
    For our JQuery page, it took 1.17 seconds to finish loading with 22.22 mb / 5.25 mb transferred and 25
    requests to load playlist 1 at 4g lte speeds. For playlist 2, it took 1.49 seconds to load the page containing 
    92.91 mb /12.28 mb transferred and 60 requests at 4g lte speeds.
    
    For our JQuery page, it took 1.50 minutes to finish loading the page with 20.53 mb / 3.50 mb transferred and 29 
    requests at 3g speeds for playlist 1. For playlist 2, it took 2.07 minutes to finish loading the page with
    134.06 mb / 6.57 mb transferred and 103 requests at 3g speeds.
    
    More data is transferred at 3g speeds because more requests were needed to load the audio
    and images
    
    It was quite easy to manipulate the DOM tree using JavaScript because we only needed to use
        document.queryselector() or document.getelementbyid(). JQuery took a very long time for
        us to manipulate the DOM tree because it was our first experience programming in JQuery.
        We learned that not everything done in Javascript can be replicated in JQuery, like 
        controlling the audio.
